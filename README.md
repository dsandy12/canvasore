# CanvasOre - Performance Indicator Data Mining Tool for Canvas LMS
## General Information
CanvasOre is a data mining tool that allows instructors to easily extract student performance against pre-defined outcome indicators at the Assignment Group, Assignment, Quiz, Rubric Criteria, or Quiz Question Bank level. While the Canvas LMS does support outcome evaluation, it it restricted to evaluation against rubrics only and does not lend itself to evaluating performance against non-rubric assessed outcomes within a typical course framework.  

### The Value Proposition
1.	CanvasOre can quickly aggregate all assessments related to a particular indicator across all course assignments.  At the end of the term, faculty can easily evaluate all scores related to each performance indicator.  This technology alleviates faculty from having to conduct tedious data extraction and it provides error-free reporting, ensuring consistent grading criteria across multiple sections of a single course.  
2.	The tool significantly reduces grading and reporting time from several hours to just a few minutes.  This feature also saves time for TAs and graders.  Reports are comprehensive and easily interpreted.
3.	CanvasOre facilitates a uniform reporting format for all courses within an ABET-accredited program.  

### Main Features
The main features of CanvasOre include:
1. Full authentication capabilities including single-sign-on and dual-factor authentication.
2. Ability to create and edit associations between course content (Assignment Group, Assignment, Rubric Criteria, Quiz and Quiz Question Bank) and course outcomes.
3. Ability to edit existing outcomes
4. Ability to apply existing outcomes to new course sections
5. Abiltiy to automatically generate XML report files showing anonymized student perofrmance against each performance indicator (outcome).
